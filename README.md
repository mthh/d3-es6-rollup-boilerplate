Included features :
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) (airbnb code style)
- Transpile ES6 code with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- Use [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to bundle Javascript code, including libraries (such as *d3-geo* features here)
- Compress code with [Uglify]()
- Development server with automated rebuild on code source change.


### Requirements

- Node.js and npm


### Getting started

Install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Start the development server (source code changes are watched and automatically rebuilded):
```
npm run dev
```

Or just build the code:
